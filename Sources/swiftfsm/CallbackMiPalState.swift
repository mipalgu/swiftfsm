/**
 *  Provides a way for developers to pass in the onEntry, main and onExit
 *  methods when initializing a `MiPalState` so that they can more easily create
 *  simple states.
 *
 *  - Warning: It is important that when creating the `_onEntry`, `_main` and
 *  `_onExit` functions, you do not refer to variables that are outside the
 *  scope of the functions.  If you do so, you will possibly introduce
 *  side-effects that cannot be detected by the Kripke Structure generation and
 *  will therefore throw off the formal verification.
 *
 *  - SeeAlso: `MiPalState`
