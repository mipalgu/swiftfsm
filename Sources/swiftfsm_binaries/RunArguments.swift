                You may specify a standard scheduler or a dispatch table file.
                Standard schedulers:
                    round-robin: Takes a snapshot of the external variables before
                        executing each ringlet in each LLFSM. The snapshot is saved
                        after executing each ringlet in each LLFSM.
                    passive-round-robin: Takes a snapshot of the external variables
                        before executing each entire schedule cycle. The snapshot is
                        saved at the end of each schedule cycle, after all LLFSMS
                        have executed a single ringlet.
                Dispatch table file format:
                    The dispatch table file format allows specifying a parallal
                    time-triggered schedule. The dispatch table consists of
                    groups of machines in timeslots which execute sequentially.
                    Each group executes in parallel to the others. Each timeslot
                    has the following format:
                        <offset-start-time> <run-time> <machine>
                    where <offset-start-time> is the time offset from the start
                    of the schedule cycle and dictates when the machine should
                    start executing. An offset of 0 indicates that the machine
                    should start executing at the beginning of a schedule cycle.
                    The <run-time> field indicates how much time the
                    machine has to execute. The worst-cast execution time of the
                    machine should not exceed this value. The <machine> field
                    represents the name of the machine in the namespace. You
                    can fetch the names of all the machines in the arrangement
                    by executing `swiftfsm show-machines <directory.arrangement>`.
                    A group consists of several lines of timeslot:
                        <timeslot1>
                        <timeslot2>
                        <timeslot3>
                    and each group is separated by a blank line:
                        <timeslot1>
                        <timeslot2>
                        <timeslot3>

                        <timeslot4>
                        <timeslot5>
                        <timeslot6>
                    In this example, timeslots 1-3 are executed in parallel to
                    timeslots 4-6.
