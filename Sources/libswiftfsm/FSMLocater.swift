/**
 *  This protocol provides a common interface for machines to be able to
 *  interact with instances of other machines which they depend on.
 *
 *  An example is machines that depend on other submachines. Through the use of
 *  this protocol, machines are able to fetch instances of other machine which
 *  can be used to perform some of the general operations provided by swiftfsm.
 *  These include suspension, resumption, restarting fsms and forcing fsms
 *  to finish.
