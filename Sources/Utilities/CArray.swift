/**
 *  A C array wrapper.
 *
 *  When attempting to use C arrays swift interprets them as tuples.  Therefore
 *  if I reference an int C array with a length of 4, I get a tuple containing
 *  4 ints: (Int, Int, Int, Int).
 *
 *  This becomes combersome as we would like to be able to use them just like
 *  normal Swift arrays.  The CArray wrapper provides this functionality.
