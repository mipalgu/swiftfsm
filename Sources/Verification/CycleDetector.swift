 *  variable that you would initialize to `initialData`.  You would then
 *  pass every `Element` within the sequence into `inCycle(data:element:)`
 *  and update the `Data` variable with the new values that are returned
 *  from `inCycle(data:element:)`.

     *  Types that use `CycleDetector`s should start with the `initialData` and
     *  then pass the `Data` to `inCycle(data:,element:)` so that the
