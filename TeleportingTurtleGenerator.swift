     *  Generate a kripke structure from the initial state of the finite state
     *  machine.
     *
     *  This uses Brents Teleporting Turtle algorithm to detect cycles within
     *  the Kripke Structure.  Once the algorithm detects that there is a cycle
     *  it starts at the inital state and loops until it finds the first
     *  occurence of the cycle and from this you would normally trim the
     *  remaining states off the end since they are just cyclying.  This
     *  trimming does not happen so you may end up with a few states that end up
     *  doing the same thing.
     *
     *  In other words the algorithm detects if a cycle has happend and stops
     *  generating the structure, but, it does not bother to remove the cyclic
     *  states from the end of the structure.
