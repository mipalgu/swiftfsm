     *  Generate a kripke structure from the initial state of the finite state
     *  machine.
     *
     *  This uses Brents Teleporting Turtle algorithm to detect cycles within
     *  the Kripke Structure.  Once the algorithm detects a potential cycle it
     *  checks every newly generated state with those that it has already seen
     *  to make sure that it is equal to the corresponding state in the cycle.
     *  If all newly generated states are equal to their corresponding states 
     *  within the cycle for the entire cycle then a cycle has been detected and
     *  the generation of the kripke state is stopped and the inital state of 
     *  the structure is returned.  Normally the algorithm would trim the cyclic
     *  states off the end but this does not happen so you may end up with a 
     *  few states on the end that are doing the same thing.
     *
     *  To summarize the algorithm detects if a cycle has happend and stops
     *  generating the structure, but, it does not bother to remove the cyclic
     *  states from the end of the structure.
